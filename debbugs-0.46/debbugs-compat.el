;; `main-thread' has been added in Emacs 27.1.
(unless (boundp 'main-thread)
  (defconst main-thread nil))

;; Function `string-replace' is new in Emacs 28.1.

;; This is needed for Bug#73199.
;; `soap-invoke-internal' let-binds `url-http-attempt-keepalives' to
;; t, which is not thread-safe.  We override this setting.  It is
;; fixed in Emacs 31.1.
